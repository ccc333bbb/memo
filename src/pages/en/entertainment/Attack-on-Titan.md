Attack on Titan is Hajime Isayama's representative work, an outstanding manga that combines action, politics, and philosophical thinking.

## Story Summary

The story is set in a world threatened by Titans, where humans are forced to live within high walls. The protagonist Eren Yeager, after witnessing his mother being devoured by a Titan, vows to exterminate all Titans.

## Personal Thoughts

What impresses me most about this work is:

### Complex World-building
- Layers of world truth gradually revealed
- Deep portrayal of politics and history
- Exploration of complex aspects of human nature

### Character Development
- Eren's transformation from avenger to complex character
- Each character has a complete growth arc
- No absolute distinction between good and evil

### Thematic Depth
- Philosophical thinking about freedom and restraint
- Complex relationship between war and peace
- Reflection on historical cycles and human nature

**Rating: 4.8/5 stars**

**Recommendation reasons:**
- Engaging plot development
- Profound philosophical and political thinking
- Excellent character development
- Shocking visual presentation

This is a work that makes people think repeatedly, not just entertainment, but also deep reflection on human nature and society.
