- **Structure**:
  - `src/pages/{lang}/projects/`
  - Project cards with thumbnails
  - Tech stack tags
  - Links to GitHub/live demos
  - Status indicators (in-progress, completed, archived)

### 3. Bookmarks Section ðŸ”–
- **Purpose**: Curated collection of useful links and resources
- **Structure**:
  - `src/pages/{lang}/bookmarks/`
  - Categorized collections
  - Description and tags for each bookmark
  - Import/export functionality

## Technical Considerations

### Content Management Strategy
- Extend GitHub Issues integration to support all content types

- Maintain consistent frontmatter across content types

### Navigation Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ Projects (NEW)
â””â”€â”€ Bookmarks (NEW)
```

- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run blog:create` - Create new blog post
- `npm run blog:list` - List all blog posts
- `npm run blog:publish <issue-number>` - Publish blog post

### Environment Setup

## Next Steps
